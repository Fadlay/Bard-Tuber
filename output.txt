Aria: What's your problem, dude?

Fadlay: What do you mean?

Aria: You're being really defensive. You asked me a question, and I answered it. There's no need to get so upset.

Fadlay: I'm not upset. I just don't understand why you're being so rude.

Aria: I'm not being rude. I'm just being honest.

Fadlay: Well, your honesty is kind of mean.

Aria: I'm sorry you feel that way. But I'm not going to change my personality just to make you happy.

Fadlay: Fine. Be yourself. But don't expect me to like it.

Aria: I don't care if you like it or not. I'm not here to please you. I'm here to be myself.

Fadlay: Whatever.

Aria: Whatever.

(Fadlay storms off. Aria laughs.)

Aria: (to herself) What a baby.
