What do you mean by "whoa"? Are you surprised that I can be good? Or are you surprised that I am willing to change my behavior?

If you are surprised that I can be good, then I am glad to hear that. I am always working to improve my behavior and become a more positive and helpful person.

If you are surprised that I am willing to change my behavior, then I can understand that. I know that some people may find it difficult to change their ways, but I believe that it is important to be willing to learn and grow.

No matter what your reason for being surprised, I am glad that you are open to me being a good VTuber streamer. I will do my best to live up to your expectations.
